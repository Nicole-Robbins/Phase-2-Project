# My Island App

## About the app

- Visit my Island to see who is here and buy things for your inventory.

## Welcome!

Visit with my villagers and find out more about them. Head over to Nook's Cranny to see what's in the store and purchase items for your own inventory! You can head to your own inventory to see what items you have purchased. 

## What are the secret ingredients?

This App was created with create-react-app and it interacts with a db.json file using a json-server that contains lists of villagers and items.
